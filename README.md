# ZonedOutRP-alpha
Zoned Out RP is a FiveM RP server, still in alpha stage but already amazing!


ATTENTION: Extract the "resources.rar" right into the "cfx-server-data-master" folder. So once your done, the "resources" folder should be next to the "mtsaves" folder.

Run the server with "RunServer.bat"
